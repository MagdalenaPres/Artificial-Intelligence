# **Artificial Intelligence**
This repository contains four projects covering different areas of Artificial Intelligence. 

## **Checkers**
Console application for playing checkers allowing you to play in human - human mode, human - AI mode and AI - AI mode. 

To perform AI movements **MinMax Algorithm** and **Alpha Beta Pruning** have been implemented. 

Several Evaluation Functions have been created including: 
- All pieces scored equally
- King Pawns scored higher than normal Pieces
- Pawns located in the half on opponent's board scored higher

Language: **Java**

## **Constraint Satisfaction Problem**
The aim of implementing the project was to get acquainted with the algorithms used for solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems on the example of two games: Binary and Futoshiki.

To solve the problems I have used following algorithms:
• Backtracking
• Forward checking

Language: **Java**


## **Genetic Algorithm**


## **Text Classification**
